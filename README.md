# My-SOC-L1-Training

Security Operations Center (SOC) Level 1 Analyst Training: Hands-on labs, tools, and resources for developing foundational cybersecurity monitoring and response skills.

As an aspiring SOC analyst, I jumped into TryHackMe’s SOC Level 1 training with a mix of excitement and a bit of nervous anticipation. This wasn’t just theory—it was a deep dive into the real tools and frameworks that power cybersecurity every day. While I expected to work with familiar names like SIEMs, Wireshark, and Snort, I was genuinely thrilled to uncover powerful new tools like Autopsy, Zeek, and OSquery that I’d never even heard of before. Each hands-on challenge pushed me further, turning complex concepts into practical skills. This journey didn’t just expand my technical toolkit—it ignited my passion for defending the digital world.
